<h1 class="center_text">implement SVM (support vector machine)</h1>

<h3><<<a href="project.html">Go back</a><a href="index.html">       Home</a></h3>
<h3>
    Goal: automate credit card approval decisions
</h3>
<p>
    Given:
    - customer information dataset which include information such as deposit, age, family member, etc..

    use:
    - Classification model
    - I decided to use support vector machine in this project

</p>
<p>
    Approach:
    - Analyze dataset and examine how to format data.
     For example, when I analyze deposit information, I normalized the dataset to make it into number between -1 and 1
    - Put data into SVM
